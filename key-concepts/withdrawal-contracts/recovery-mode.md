# â›‘ Recovery Mode

### &#x20;All the Reasons for Recovery Mode

* Withdrawal Contract is expired (not likely).

* **Withdrawal Queues and Token transfers continue as usual. ðŸ™‚**
* **No more minting** is allowed by the Portal, meaning `deposit()`calls _might_ fail.
* **No more validator proposals** can be activated, meaning `stakeBeacon()` calls _will_ fail.
