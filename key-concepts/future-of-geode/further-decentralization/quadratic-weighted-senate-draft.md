# Quadratic Weighted Senate (DRAFT)

#### Senates are elected every year, they secure the underlying code. Senate elections are one of the most important events that will happen in the Geode's future.

Currently, every Planet has 1 vote in these elections and Comets doesn't have any.&#x20;

#### This doesn't seem fair.

We propose the implementation of weighted Senate Elections that uses the amount of staked tokens to give linear voting power to a Staking Pool's Maintainer.

We also propose to include a specific amount for Governance Fees that will be fixed within the period of the elected Senate.

#### Thus, we will be able to achieve 4 improvements:

1. Comets will now have a say in the Senate Elections
2. Planets can be made permissionless.
3. IDs can be used for market making.
4. Governance Fees can be negotiable.

#### This proposal also allows Senate-less implementations to be possible in the future.

"Senate" logic is still not decentralized enough.

Since we can achieve Permissionless Planets, now there are only 2 functionalities that will be secured by the Senate:

* Contract upgrades
* Node Operator Onboarding

both of these are not frequent events and can be handled directly by the Maintainer votes.
