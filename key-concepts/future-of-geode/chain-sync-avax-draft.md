# Chain Sync (AVAX) (draft)

### Staking is a chain specific problem.

Every blockchain has a different approach to the Proof of Stake, and every approach requires a different solution to be found.

Currently, there are some implementations that are used to solve chain-specific problems of Avalanche blockchains. These are mostly related to the multi-chain structure of the chain.

With this improvement we are aiming to achieve two things:

* Eliminate chain-specific differences between Portal deployments on Avalanche and Ethereum.
  * Makes development processes easier, allowing us to provide more frequent improvements on the protocol without considering differences within code.
  * Makes onboarding of protocols on different blockchain easier. &#x20;
* Increase trustlessness of the Node Operators.
  * Allows us to onboard more Operators.
  * Allows us to decrease costs for Operators.
  * Strengthens Portal.&#x20;
