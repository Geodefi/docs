# ðŸ”´ Regulating the Marketplace

#### Simply it **regulates itself with a healthy competition.**&#x20;

Node Operators can set a fee up to 10% for their services.

{% hint style="success" %}
Contrary to other staking pools, Operators collect their fee according to the performance of their validators; encouraging them to be more profitable.
{% endhint %}

Any pool can work with any Node Operator, w_ith minimal disturbance_. However, the pool controllers should consider some parameters, such as:

* Fee
* Validator Period
* Number of Total Validators
* Past Performance
* Country/Regulation

### "Minimal Disturbance"

#### There are some ground rules to protect the all parties from each other.

* There is a 3 day cooldown period when a pool maintenance fee is changed.
* There is a 3 day cooldown period when an operator fee is changed.
* There is a 3 day cooldown period when a validator period is changed.
* There is a 14 day isolation period for faulty or malicious Node Operators, called prison:
