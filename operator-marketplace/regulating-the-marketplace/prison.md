# ðŸš¨ Prison

#### Prison isolates the Node Operators from the Marketplace, in case they act in a faulty or malicious manner:

* Invalid validator proposal.
* Not withdrawing validator funds before the expected exit time.
* Not routing the block rewards, or MEV rewards to the Withdrawal Contract. &#x20;

The Prison Sentence for any of these infractions is 14 days.
