# ðŸ”µ Maintenance Fee

Pool Owners are responsible from various tasks, such as:

* Managing the pool variables, like fee and maintainer.
* Choosing the operator subset.
* Securing the Withdrawal Contract by upgrading it whenever it is necessary.

In return, they can charge <mark style="color:purple;">**up to 10%**</mark> of the staking yield.

#### It is important to note that the maintenance fee is not a staking-as-a-service fee.
