## An <mark style="color:purple;">Open Market</mark> Built on Top of a <mark style="color:green;">Permissionless</mark> <mark style="color:green;">Global Standard.</mark>

1. Geode's Staking Library utilizes an immutable token that is called gETH. It is the internal **database of our Trustless Staking Derivatives.**

* The **risk** associated with different staking derivatives are **isolated**.

2. These derivatives are maintained by **Configurable Staking Pools**.

* These pools are **permissionless.** They can be created by **any centralized or decentralized entities, and even solo users**.

3. Staking Pools can easily work with any subset of Permissioned and Permissionless Node Operators, via the **Operator Marketplace**.

* These Pools and Marketplace are hosted within a smart contract called **Geode Portal**.

4. Operators and Pools are unique, they are not pooled.

* The marketplace **regulates itself** with healthy competition.

5. Portal utilizes a **Modular approach** on Maintainers, Interfaces, Whitelists, Liquidity, etc.

* Nothing is decided. Things are customizable. **Everything is possible**.

6. Portal defines the interactions between _users and pools_, and _pools and operators_.

* An **improved user experience** for everyone, without sacrificing any possible features.

7. Validators are **unique and immutable** after creation.

* Changing associated parameters, such as fees, doesn't affect the previously created validators.&#x20;

8. Fees are charged after a validator's withdrawal.

* **Protecting the stakers** until the previously agreed deal is over.

9. When a validator is created, Portal no longer holds any ownership on the pooled funds.

* The Portal is upgradable, but guarded with a **Dual Governance**.

10. **Withdrawal Contracts** are the "owners" of the validators.&#x20;

* Every staking pool has a unique Withdrawal Contract that is guarded by the Pool Owner.

11. Trustlessness and Scalability are secured for future implementations, ensuring future staking innovations can be implemented.&#x20;

* To make things like Synthetic Minting, Dynamic Withdrawals, etc. possible, Geode provides a bound liquidity pool as well.
