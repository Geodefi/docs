# The Staking Library

## Current State of Staking Derivatives

There are 3 main issues with the current design of the Staking Derivatives market.

* Monopolization
* Sustainability
* Trust

> All these issues are significantly related to each other. During our research we concluded that it all comes down to one: _<mark style="color:green;">Trust</mark>_.

#### To overcome them, we researched and improved our understanding further:

## Staking Reimagined:

### An <mark style="color:purple;">Open Market</mark> Built on Top of a <mark style="color:green;">Permissionless</mark> <mark style="color:green;">Global Standard.</mark>

The market was disrupted when the first version of Permissionless Decentralized Exchanges were created. The risk of Centralized Exchanges is theoretically mitigated, since anyone is able to create a Contract Owned Liquidity Pool now.

#### Geode provides a Permissionless Staking Library that allows anyone to craft, create and maintain their own <mark style="color:purple;">trustless</mark> staking solution.

### Simple...

* Takes 1 Tx to create a staking pool.
* Allows choosing a subset of Node Operators, can easily change it afterwards.
* Every pool is segregated, thus the risk is isolated.
* Every validator is unique, thus the risk is isolated.
* Immutable token contract, securing the stakers' tokens.
* Geode Governance can not upgrade but only propose upgrades on unique instances of the library.

### â€¦ we don't need intermediaries anymore:
